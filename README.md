# rAndroid_Appstore
r/Android appstore for apps made by redditors!

Over at 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/50rafp/meta_we_have_an_app_wiki_with_over_700_apps_made/ 
the mods have asked the community to write them a appstore.

##If you are interested in contributing, until the mods set up a more 
organized form, please send a PR and add your reddit username to this 
list, and at the least, I will make sure they are aware of it and who 
wants to help!

##/u/mDarken and I have begun writing a prototype at https://github.com/d4rken/reddit-android-appstore please send all your contributions there! Lets make a app made by everyone! We will be accepting pull requests, so start contributing!
